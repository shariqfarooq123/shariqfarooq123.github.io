## Hi, I'm Shariq
I am a PhD student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa), working under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Wonka](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EKXSXgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My primary research focus is on Computer Vision, specifically depth estimation and 3D reconstruction in general. I have published works that have led to state-of-the-art results in the past three consecutive years. My research has been applied in various fields, from under-water systems and robotic navigation to AR/VR pipelines and art creation. I am also interested in exploring the potential of 3D neural fields.<br>

I have also gained industrial experience working as a **Research Scientist intern** at [**Intel Labs**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), **Research Intern** at **University College London / Adobe**, a **Data Scientist** at a [startup](https://www.prakshep.com/), and **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Harman International](https://www.harman.com). Get in touch with me today to hire me, discuss potential collaborations or to learn more about my work.
